# Changelog

All notable changes to Tado CE will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.1] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Duplicate hub cleanup race condition** (Issue #10): Fixed race condition where duplicate entries from v1.1.0 upgrade couldn't be deleted. Changed from non-blocking (`async_create_task`) to blocking removal (`await`) to ensure old entries are fully removed before new one continues setup.
- **Multi-device zone entity naming** (Issue #11): Fixed confusing entity names for zones with multiple devices (e.g., 1 sensor + 2 valves). Entity names now include device type + index suffix when needed (e.g., "Living Room VA02 (1) Battery", "Living Room VA02 (2) Battery", "Living Room RU01 Battery").
- **Migration handling**: Enhanced `async_migrate_entry` to gracefully handle missing `zones_info.json` file during upgrade.
- **Duplicate prevention**: Added unique ID check in config flow to prevent duplicate integration entries.

### Changed
- **Improved duplicate cleanup**: Now uses blocking removal to prevent race conditions during upgrade.
- **Smart entity naming**: Single-device zones keep simple names, multi-device zones get device type + index suffixes for clarity.
- **README updates**: Added comprehensive troubleshooting section for upgrade issues.

### Notes
- **Automatic cleanup**: Upgrading from v1.1.0 will automatically remove duplicate entries - no manual action needed.
- **Entity IDs preserved**: Entity IDs remain unchanged - automations will continue to work.
- **Multi-device zones**: Battery, connection, and child lock entities now have clearer names with device type + index.

### Community Credits
- **Issue #10**: @marcovn, @ChrisMarriott38, @hapklaar (duplicate hub issue)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-21

> **Development Note**: This release underwent comprehensive engineering audit. All 7 critical fixes verified.

### Breaking Changes
- **Zone-based device organization**: Each Tado zone now appears as a separate device. Zone entities are assigned to their respective zone devices, while hub entities remain on the Tado CE Hub device. Entity IDs are preserved - automations will continue to work.
- **Improved entity naming**: Zone entities no longer have "Tado CE" prefix (e.g., "Living Room" instead of "Tado CE Living Room"). Hub entities retain "Tado CE" prefix for clarity.

### Added
- **Centralized authentication manager** (`auth_manager.py`): Thread-safe token management with 300s caching, eliminates duplicate refresh calls
- **Centralized error handler** (`error_handler.py`): Consistent error handling with automatic retry, entity availability management, and graceful degradation
- **API call tracking for home state**: Added `CALL_TYPE_HOME_STATE = 7` to track `/api/v2/homes/{id}/state` calls
- **Optional weather sensors**: Toggle weather sensors on/off in integration options (disabled by default for new installations, saves 1 API call per sync)
- **Customizable polling intervals**: Configure custom day/night hours and polling intervals in integration options
- **Enhanced immediate refresh**: Quota-aware triggering with exponential backoff (10s → 20s → 40s → 80s → 160s → 300s)
- **Device manager** (`device_manager.py`): Manages zone-based device organization
- **Config manager** (`config_manager.py`): Centralized configuration management with validation

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Token refresh race condition**: Multiple concurrent API calls could trigger duplicate token refreshes. Fixed with centralized `AuthManager` using thread-safe locking and token caching.
- **CRITICAL: Thread safety in immediate refresh**: Fixed `async_create_task` being called from synchronous methods in `climate.py`, `water_heater.py`, and `switch.py`. Now uses `call_soon_threadsafe` for proper async task scheduling.
- **HIGH: Incomplete API call tracking**: Home state API calls were not being tracked. Now all API calls are properly tracked for accurate quota monitoring.
- **HIGH: Immediate refresh without rate limiting**: Rapid user actions could exhaust API quota. Fixed with quota checking, increased minimum interval (5s → 10s), and exponential backoff.
- **MEDIUM: Rate limit reset time calculation**: Buggy modulo logic caused incorrect reset time display. Implemented three-strategy approach (API-provided → calculated from last reset → estimated from history).
- **MEDIUM: Database performance**: API limit sensor stored 20KB of data exceeding Home Assistant's 16KB limit. Optimized to store only last 100 calls (~10KB, 53% reduction).

### Changed
- **API usage optimization**: Normal polling now uses 1-2 API calls (quick sync) instead of 4. Full sync only every 6 hours. Estimated 60-70% reduction in API calls.
- **Weather sensors default**: Disabled by default for new installations to save API calls. Existing users' settings preserved.
- **Immediate refresh interval**: Increased minimum interval from 5s to 10s to prevent quota exhaustion.
- **Error handling**: All API calls now use centralized error handler with automatic retry and entity availability management.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-19

### Added
- **Away Mode switch**: New `switch.tado_ce_away_mode` to manually toggle Home/Away status (1 API call per toggle)
- **Preset mode support**: Climate entities now support Home/Away presets (1 API call per change)
- **Humidity on climate**: Climate entities now show `current_humidity` attribute (no extra API calls - uses existing data)

### Changed
- **Device organization**: All entities (climate, switches, sensors) are now linked to the Tado CE Hub device for better organization in Home Assistant
- Updated all entity `device_info` to reference the Hub device

### API Usage Notes
- Away Mode switch: 1 API call per toggle
- Preset mode change: 1 API call per change
- Humidity attribute: No additional API calls (uses existing zone data)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-18

### Fixed
- **Auto-fetch home ID**: The integration now automatically fetches your home ID from your Tado account using the `/me` endpoint instead of using a hardcoded value
- **403 "user is not a resident" error**: New users no longer encounter this error during setup

### Changed
- Removed hardcoded `DEFAULT_HOME_ID` constant
- Home ID is now automatically discovered and saved to config on first API call

### Notes
- If upgrading from 1.0.0, delete `/config/custom_components/tado_ce/data/config.json` and re-authenticate
