## Why Tado CE?

In late 2025, Tado announced they would begin enforcing **daily API rate limits** on their REST API. This caught many Home Assistant users off guard:

| Plan | Daily Limit |
|------|-------------|
| Standard (after grace period) | 100 calls |
| Standard (grace period) | 5,000 calls |
| Auto-Assist subscription | 20,000 calls |

The official Home Assistant Tado integration doesn't show your actual API usage or remaining quota. Users have no way to know if they're about to hit the limit until they get blocked.

**Common issues reported by the community:**

- [Upcoming changes to the tado API](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/151223) - Official announcement
- [Tado rate limiting API calls](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/tado-rate-limiting-api-calls/928751) - Community discussion
- [Tado Authentication Broken](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/160472) - Auth issues after HA update
- [Tado login fails](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/161054) - Login timeout issues
- [Re-Authentication loop](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/160237) - Keeps asking for re-auth
- [Bad error handling](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/160487) - Poor error messages
- [Tado Integration Stopped Working](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/tado-integration-stopped-working/867145) - Password flow deprecated

**Tado CE was created to solve these problems:**

1. **Real-time rate limit tracking** - See exactly how many API calls you've used
2. **Dynamic limit detection** - Automatically detects your actual limit (100/5000/20000)
3. **Reset time tracking** - Know when your quota resets (from Tado API headers)
4. **Smart day/night polling** - More frequent during day, less at night
5. **Lightweight design** - Minimal API calls, maximum functionality

---

### 4. Device Overview

Once set up, you'll see your Tado zones organized as separate devices with clean entity names.

---

## Entities

### API Sensors (Hub Entities)

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `sensor.tado_ce_api_usage` | API calls used today (e.g. "142/5000") |
| `sensor.tado_ce_api_reset` | Time until rate limit resets (e.g. "5h 30m") |

### Weather Sensors (Hub Entities)

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `sensor.tado_ce_outside_temperature` | Outside temperature at your location |
| `sensor.tado_ce_solar_intensity` | Solar intensity percentage |
| `sensor.tado_ce_weather_state` | Current weather condition |

### Per Heating Zone (Zone Entities - No Prefix)

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `climate.{zone}` | Climate entity for control |
| `sensor.{zone}_temperature` | Current temperature |
| `sensor.{zone}_humidity` | Current humidity |
| `sensor.{zone}_heating` | Heating power (0-100%) |
| `sensor.{zone}_target` | Target temperature |
| `sensor.{zone}_mode` | Mode (Manual/Schedule/Off) |
| `sensor.{zone}_battery` | Battery status (NORMAL/LOW) |
| `sensor.{zone}_connection` | Device connection (Online/Offline) |
| `binary_sensor.{zone}_open_window` | Open window detected |

**Note:** `{zone}` is your zone name in lowercase with spaces replaced by underscores. For example, "Living Room" becomes `living_room`.

### Switches (Zone & Hub Entities)

| Entity | Description | API Calls |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `switch.tado_ce_away_mode` | Toggle Home/Away mode manually (Hub) | 1 per toggle |
| `switch.{zone}_child_lock` | Enable/disable child lock (Zone) | 1 per toggle |
| `switch.{zone}_early_start` | Enable/disable smart pre-heating (Zone) | 1 per toggle |

### Other Entities

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `binary_sensor.tado_ce_home` | Home/Away status (geofencing) - Hub |
| `water_heater.{zone}` | Hot water control with AUTO/HEAT/OFF modes |
| `sensor.{zone}_boiler_flow_temperature` | Boiler flow temperature (hot water zones only) |

|-----------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| 100 | 30 min | 2 hours | ~80 calls |
| 1,000 | 15 min | 1 hour | ~160 calls |
| 5,000 | 10 min | 30 min | ~240 calls |
| 20,000 | 5 min | 15 min | ~480 calls |

### 100 Calls/Day Breakdown

| Time Period | Duration | Interval | Syncs | Calls | Total |
|-------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|-------|
| Day (7am-11pm) | 16h | 30 min | 32 | 2 | 64 |
| Night (11pm-7am) | 8h | 2h | 4 | 2 | 8 |
| Full sync | 24h | 6h | 4 | 2 | 8 |
| **Total** | | | | | **80** |

This leaves a 20% buffer for manual syncs or service calls.

## Troubleshooting

### Token refresh failed / Re-authentication required

1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Tado CE**
2. Click **Configure** or look for re-authentication prompt
3. Follow the device authorization flow (link + code)

### Check status

Check your Home Assistant logs: **Settings > System > Logs**

Filter by "tado_ce" to see integration-specific messages.

### No device tracker entities

Device trackers only appear for mobile devices with geo tracking enabled in the Tado app.

### Enable debug logging

For detailed troubleshooting, enable debug logging in your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.tado_ce: debug
```

This will show detailed information about:
- Token refresh operations and caching
- API call tracking with timestamps
- Rate limit header parsing
- Polling interval calculations
- Quota availability checks
- Configuration updates

After adding this, restart Home Assistant and check **Settings > System > Logs** for detailed debug information.
