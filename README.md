## 🤔 Why Tado CE?

In late 2025, Tado announced they would begin enforcing **daily API rate limits** on their REST API. This caught many Home Assistant users off guard:

| Plan | Daily Limit |
|------|-------------|
| Standard (after grace period) | 100 calls |
| Standard (grace period) | 5,000 calls |
| Auto-Assist subscription | 20,000 calls |

The official Home Assistant Tado integration doesn't show your actual API usage or remaining quota. Users have no way to know if they're about to hit the limit until they get blocked.

**Common issues reported by the community:**

- [Upcoming changes to the tado° API](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/151223) - Official announcement
- [Tado rate limiting API calls](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/tado-rate-limiting-api-calls/928751) - Community discussion
- [Tado Authentication Broken](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/160472) - Auth issues after HA update
- [Tado login fails](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/161054) - Login timeout issues
- [Re-Authentication loop](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/160237) - Keeps asking for re-auth
- [Bad error handling](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/160487) - Poor error messages
- [Tado Integration Stopped Working](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/tado-integration-stopped-working/867145) - Password flow deprecated

**Tado CE was created to solve these problems:**

1. **Real-time rate limit tracking** - See exactly how many API calls you've used
2. **Dynamic limit detection** - Automatically detects your actual limit (100/5000/20000)
3. **Reset time tracking** - Know when your quota resets (from Tado API headers)
4. **Smart day/night polling** - More frequent during day, less at night
5. **Lightweight design** - Minimal API calls, maximum functionality

## 🔄 Migrating from v1.1.0 to v1.2.x

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: v1.2.0+ includes breaking changes. Please read carefully before upgrading.**

### What's Changed

1. **Service Name Change** (Breaking Change)
   - `set_temperature_offset` renamed to `set_climate_temperature_offset`
   - **Action Required**: Update your automations to use the new service name
   - Parameters remain unchanged
   
   ```yaml
   # Old (v1.1.0)
   service: tado_ce.set_temperature_offset
   
   # New (v1.2.0)
   service: tado_ce.set_climate_temperature_offset
   ```

2. **Zone-Based Devices** (Breaking Change)
   - Each Tado zone now appears as a separate device
   - Zone entities are assigned to their respective zone devices
   - Hub entities remain on the Tado CE Hub device
   - **Entity IDs are preserved** - automations continue to work

3. **Improved Entity Names**
   - Zone entities no longer have "Tado CE" prefix
   - Example: "Living Room Temperature" instead of "Tado CE Living Room Temperature"
   - Hub entities retain "Tado CE" prefix

### Migration Steps

**⚠️ If upgrading from v1.1.0, the integration will automatically clean up any duplicate hubs. This issue is fixed in v1.2.1.**

**Recommended Upgrade Path (Clean Install):**

1. **Backup Your Configuration**
   - Export automations and dashboards
   - Take screenshots of your current setup

2. **Remove Old Integration**
   - Settings → Devices & Services → Tado CE → "..." → Delete
   - If you see two Tado CE entries, delete both

3. **Restart Home Assistant**

4. **Re-add the Integration**
   - Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Tado CE
   - Your entity IDs will be preserved

**Alternative: Update in Place (v1.2.1+)**

If you're upgrading to v1.2.1 or later, the integration includes automatic migration:

1. **Update Automations First**
   - Search for `tado_ce.set_temperature_offset`
   - Replace with `tado_ce.set_climate_temperature_offset`
   - Update hot water automations: `operation_mode: "on"` → `operation_mode: "heat"`

2. **Update via HACS**
   - HACS → Integrations → Tado CE → Update
   - Restart Home Assistant
   - Migration will run automatically

3. **Verify Everything Works**
   - Check you only have ONE Tado CE hub
   - Verify all zones are visible
   - Test manual controls

### Troubleshooting Upgrade Issues

**Problem: Two Tado CE Hubs After Upgrade**

This was an issue when upgrading from v1.1.0 to v1.2.0. **Fixed in v1.2.1** with automatic cleanup.

**If you're on v1.2.1+**: The integration will automatically remove duplicate entries on startup.

**If you're still on v1.2.0 with duplicates**: Update to v1.2.1 first, or:
1. Remove BOTH integration entries (Settings → Devices & Services → Tado CE → Delete)
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Re-add the integration

**Problem: Missing zones_info.json Error**

```
Failed to load zone names: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 
'/config/custom_components/tado_ce/data/zones_info.json'
```

**Solution:**
- This file is created automatically on first sync
- If error persists, restart Home Assistant to trigger a full sync

**Problem: All Entities Still Have "Tado CE" Prefix**

This means the old integration entry is still active.

**Solution:**
1. Remove all Tado CE integration entries
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Re-add the integration

### Update Automations
   - Search for `tado_ce.set_temperature_offset`
   - Replace with `tado_ce.set_climate_temperature_offset`
   - Update hot water automations: `operation_mode: "on"` → `operation_mode: "heat"`
   
   **Hot Water Mode Change Example:**
   ```yaml
   # Old (v1.1.0)
   service: water_heater.set_operation_mode
   target:
     entity_id: water_heater.utility
   data:
     operation_mode: "on"
   
   # New (v1.2.0)
   service: water_heater.set_operation_mode
   target:
     entity_id: water_heater.utility
   data:
     operation_mode: "heat"
   ```

3. **Upgrade the Integration**
   - Update via HACS or manual installation
   - Restart Home Assistant

4. **Verify Everything Works**
   - Check all automations are working
   - Verify dashboard cards show correct data
   - Test manual controls

### What You'll See After Upgrade

- ✅ New devices appear for each zone (e.g., "Living Room", "Bedroom")
- ✅ Entities move from hub device to zone devices
- ✅ Entity names are cleaner (no "Tado CE" prefix for zones)
- ✅ All entity IDs remain the same
- ✅ Automations continue to work (after service name update)

### Need Help?

### 🔍 Verifying Configuration Changes

**Important**: Configuration changes take effect **immediately** without requiring a Home Assistant restart. The integration automatically reloads when you save options.

#### How to Verify Options Are Working

**1. Test Mode Verification**

When Test Mode is enabled, check the logs to confirm it's active:

```bash
# SSH into Home Assistant
ha core logs | grep -i "test mode"
```

**Example: Enabling Test Mode**

When you enable Test Mode in the UI and save:

```
2026-01-21 08:40:18 WARNING (MainThread) [custom_components.tado_ce] Tado CE: Integration loading...
2026-01-21 08:40:18 WARNING (MainThread) [custom_components.tado_ce] Tado CE: Already setup, cancelling old polling timer
2026-01-21 08:40:18 WARNING (SyncWorker_1) [custom_components.tado_ce] Tado CE: Test Mode limit reached (281/100 calls). Polling paused until quota resets.
2026-01-21 08:40:18 WARNING (MainThread) [custom_components.tado_ce] Tado CE: Integration loaded successfully
```

**What this means:**
- Integration automatically reloaded (no manual restart needed)
- Test Mode detected 281 calls > 100 limit
- Polling paused until quota resets

**Example: Disabling Test Mode**

When you disable Test Mode in the UI and save:

```
2026-01-21 08:41:34 WARNING (MainThread) [custom_components.tado_ce] Tado CE: Integration loading...
2026-01-21 08:41:34 WARNING (MainThread) [custom_components.tado_ce] Tado CE: Already setup, cancelling old polling timer
2026-01-21 08:41:35 WARNING (MainThread) [custom_components.tado_ce] Tado CE: Integration loaded successfully
```

**What this means:**
- Integration automatically reloaded
- No "Test Mode limit reached" message
- Polling resumed with real API limit (e.g., 5000 calls)

**2. Weather Sensors Verification**

After changing the weather sensors option:

```bash
# Check for weather sensor entities
ha core logs | grep -i "weather"
```

**Weather Enabled:**
```
2026-01-21 08:45:00 WARNING (MainThread) [custom_components.tado_ce.sensor] Tado CE sensors loaded: 75
```

Check for these entities:
- `sensor.tado_ce_outside_temperature`
- `sensor.tado_ce_solar_intensity`
- `sensor.tado_ce_weather_state`

**Weather Disabled:**
```
2026-01-21 08:45:00 WARNING (MainThread) [custom_components.tado_ce.sensor] Tado CE sensors loaded: 72
```

Weather sensor entities will not be created (3 fewer sensors).

**3. Mobile Device Tracking Verification**

After changing the mobile device tracking option:

```bash
# Check for device tracker entities
ha core logs | grep -i "device tracker"
```

**Mobile Tracking Enabled:**
```
2026-01-21 08:45:00 WARNING (MainThread) [custom_components.tado_ce.device_tracker] Tado CE: Mobile device tracking enabled
```

Check for `device_tracker.tado_ce_{device}` entities (only if devices have geo tracking enabled in Tado app).

**Mobile Tracking Disabled:**
```
2026-01-21 08:45:00 WARNING (MainThread) [custom_components.tado_ce.device_tracker] Tado CE: No devices with geo tracking enabled
```

Device tracker entities will not be created.

**4. Polling Interval Verification**

After changing day/night hours or custom intervals:

```bash
# Check polling interval
ha core logs | grep -i "polling interval"
```

**Example Output:**
```
2026-01-21 08:45:00 INFO [custom_components.tado_ce] Tado CE: Polling interval set to 30m (day)
```

The interval shown depends on:
- Your API quota (100/1000/5000/20000)
- Current time (day vs night)
- Custom intervals (if configured)
- Test Mode (if enabled)

**5. API History Retention Verification**

Check the `sensor.tado_ce_api_limit` entity attributes to see how many calls are tracked:

```yaml
recent_calls_count: 100  # Should match your retention setting
total_calls_tracked: XXX
```

**6. Hot Water Timer Duration Verification**

After changing the timer duration:
1. Go to your hot water heater entity
2. Select "HEAT" mode
3. Check the logs:

```bash
ha core logs | grep -i "timer"
```

You should see your configured duration being used.

#### Troubleshooting Configuration Changes

If changes don't seem to take effect:

1. **Check the logs** for any errors during reload:
   ```bash
   ha core logs | grep -i "tado ce"
   ```

2. **Verify config.json was updated**:
   ```bash
   cat /config/custom_components/tado_ce/data/config.json
   ```

3. **Manual restart** (last resort):
   ```bash
   ha core restart
   ```

**Note**: The integration automatically reloads when you save configuration changes. You should see "Tado CE: Options changed, reloading integration..." in the logs.

```yaml
type: vertical-stack
cards:
  # Water Heater Card
  - type: thermostat
    entity: water_heater.YOUR_ZONE_NAME
    name: Hot Water
    features:
      - type: climate-hvac-modes
        hvac_modes:
          - auto
          - heat
          - 'off'
  
  # Boiler Temperature
  - type: entities
    entities:
      - entity: sensor.YOUR_ZONE_NAME_boiler_flow_temperature
        name: Boiler Flow Temperature
        icon: mdi:thermometer
  
  # Timer Preset Buttons
  - type: horizontal-stack
    cards:
      - type: button
        entity: button.YOUR_ZONE_NAME_30min_timer
        name: 30 min
        icon: mdi:timer-outline

service: tado_ce.identify_device
data:
  device_serial: "VA1234567890"
```

### tado_ce.set_away_configuration

Configure temperature when everyone is away.

```yaml
service: tado_ce.set_away_configuration
data:
  entity_id: climate.lounge
  mode: auto  # auto, manual, or off
  comfort_level: 50  # 0=Eco, 50=Balance, 100=Comfort
```

### tado_ce.add_meter_reading

Add energy meter reading for Energy IQ. **Enhanced in Tado CE with historical date support.**

```yaml
service: tado_ce.add_meter_reading
data:
  reading: 12345
  date: "2026-01-17"  # Optional - defaults to today (Tado CE enhancement)
```

**Tado CE Enhancement**: Unlike the official integration, Tado CE allows you to specify a date for historical readings. This is useful for catching up on missed readings or importing historical data.

## ⏱️ Smart Polling

The integration automatically adjusts polling frequency based on your API limit and time of day.

### Polling Schedule

| API Limit | Day (7am-11pm) | Night (11pm-7am) | Est. Calls/Day |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| 100 | 30 min | 2 hours | ~80 calls |
| 1,000 | 15 min | 1 hour | ~160 calls |
| 5,000 | 10 min | 30 min | ~240 calls |
| 20,000 | 5 min | 15 min | ~480 calls |

### 100 Calls/Day Breakdown

| Time Period | Duration | Interval | Syncs | Calls | Total |
|-------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|-------|
| Day (7am-11pm) | 16h | 30 min | 32 | 2 | 64 |
| Night (11pm-7am) | 8h | 2h | 4 | 2 | 8 |
| Full sync | 24h | 6h | 4 | 2 | 8 |
| **Total** | | | | | **80** |

This leaves a 20% buffer for manual syncs or service calls.

## 📱 Supported Devices

| Device | Type | Support |
|--------|------|---------|
| Smart Thermostat V3/V3+ | HEATING | ✅ Full |
| Smart Radiator Thermostat (SRT/VA02) | HEATING | ✅ Full |
| Smart AC Control V3/V3+ | AIR_CONDITIONING | ✅ Full |
| Wireless Temperature Sensor | HEATING | ✅ Full |
| Internet Bridge V3 | Infrastructure | N/A |
| **Tado X Series** | Matter/Thread | ❌ Not Supported |

### ⚠️ Tado X Devices

Tado X devices use Matter over Thread and are **not supported** by this integration. Use the Home Assistant Matter integration instead.

See [Using tado° Smart Thermostat X through Matter](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/using-tado-smart-thermostat-x-through-matter/736576) for setup instructions.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

| Limitation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Cloud-Only** | All control goes through Tado's cloud servers |
| **No GPS** | Device trackers only show home/not_home status |
| **Rotating Tokens** | If token expires, re-authentication required |
| **No Schedule Management** | Use Tado app for schedule changes |
| **No Historical Data** | Would consume too many API calls |

---

## 🔮 Potential Future Features

These features are technically possible but not yet implemented. PRs welcome!

### ✅ Can Be Added (API Available)

| Feature | Description | API Calls | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| **Boost Mode** | Quick temperature boost for X minutes | 1 per action | Medium |
| **Open Window Duration** | Configure open window detection timeout | 1 per zone | Low |
| **Multiple Homes** | Support for users with multiple Tado homes | +2 per home | Low |
| **Air Comfort** | Humidity comfort level indicators | +1 per sync | Medium |
| **Skills/Routines** | Tado's built-in automation rules | Read-only | Low |

### ❌ Cannot Be Added (API Limitations)

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| **Local Control** | Tado has no local API - cloud only |
| **GPS Coordinates** | Privacy - API only returns home/away status |
| **Schedule Editing** | Complex API, high call cost, use Tado app |
| **Push Notifications** | No webhook/push API available |
| **Tado X Devices** | Uses Matter protocol, not REST API |
| **Historical Charts** | Would require 100+ API calls per day |
| **Real-time Updates** | No WebSocket API, polling only |

### 🤔 Considering (Need User Feedback)

| Feature | Trade-off |
|---------|-----------|
| **Air Comfort Sensors** | +1 API call per sync, shows humidity comfort |
| **Boost Button** | Adds button entity, 1 API call per press |
| **Presence Confidence** | Show % confidence of presence detection |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Token refresh failed / Re-authentication required

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Tado CE**
2. Click **Configure** or look for re-authentication prompt
3. Follow the device authorization flow (link + code)

### Check status

Check your Home Assistant logs: **Settings → System → Logs**

Filter by "tado_ce" to see integration-specific messages.

### No device tracker entities

Device trackers only appear for mobile devices with geo tracking enabled in the Tado app.

### Enable debug logging

For detailed troubleshooting, enable debug logging in your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.tado_ce: debug
```

This will show detailed information about:
- Token refresh operations and caching
- API call tracking with timestamps
- Rate limit header parsing
- Polling interval calculations
- Quota availability checks
- Configuration updates

After adding this, restart Home Assistant and check **Settings → System → Logs** for detailed debug information.
