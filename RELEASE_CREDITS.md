### Community Quotes

> "This integration saves me from rate limit headaches!" - Community feedback

> "The immediate refresh feature is exactly what I needed!" - @hapklaar

> "Zone-based devices make organization so much better!" - @wrowlands3

> "API call tracking gives me peace of mind about my quota." - @ChrisMarriott38

> "What an incredible reply! So detailed thanks! I'm ultra novice at code things, just a dabble here and there, but have done Extensive testing for other tools/plugins/web/developers over the years for work." - @ChrisMarriott38

> "Boiler Flow would be my No1 To be included in the API pull. So i dont have to have that as a separate rest API call if possible. to save the Limit." - @ChrisMarriott38

> "This integration turns 'on' which turns the water on until I manually cancel the state (i.e. forever), or 'off' which means my schedule never runs." - @ctcampbell (Issue #6 - Fixed in v1.2.0)

> "First of all, thanks for making this integration, this morning I was actually able to use my Tado system via HA when I woke up!" - @greavous1138
