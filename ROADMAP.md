## Completed

### v1.2.0 (2026-01-21)

**Note**: v1.2.0 combines all planned features from both v1.2.0 and v1.3.0 into a single release.

**New Features:**
- [x] Zone-based device organization (each zone as separate device)
- [x] Improved entity naming (removed "Tado CE" prefix from zone entities)
- [x] Optional weather sensors (disable to save 1 API call per sync)
- [x] Optional mobile device tracking (disable to save 1 API call per full sync)
- [x] API call history tracking with call type codes
- [x] Test Mode switch (enforce 100-call limit for testing)
- [x] Reset time as actual timestamp attribute
- [x] Configurable API history retention (0-365 days)
- [x] Hot water operation modes (AUTO/HEAT/OFF) with proper timer support
- [x] Hot water timer preset buttons (30/60/90 minutes quick access)
- [x] Custom water heater timer service (`tado_ce.set_water_heater_timer`)
- [x] Boiler flow temperature sensor (for hot water zones)
- [x] Configurable hot water timer duration (5-1440 minutes, default 60)
- [x] Customizable day/night hours for smart polling
- [x] Manual polling interval override (custom day/night intervals)
- [x] Advanced API management configuration UI
- [x] Config flow migration system (VERSION 2)
- [x] Immediate refresh after user actions

**Bug Fixes & Improvements:**
- [x] Fixed token refresh race condition (centralized AuthManager)
- [x] Fixed home state API calls not being tracked
- [x] Fixed immediate refresh quota checking (prevents quota exhaustion)
- [x] Fixed rate limit reset time calculation (removed buggy modulo logic)
- [x] Fixed thread safety issue in immediate refresh (async_create_task from sync context)
- [x] Fixed database performance (API sensor attributes optimized, 53% size reduction)
- [x] Improved immediate refresh with exponential backoff (10s → 20s → 40s → 80s → 160s → 300s)
- [x] Improved rate limit calculation (three-strategy approach for accuracy)
- [x] Improved logging levels (INFO for normal operations, DEBUG for troubleshooting)
- [x] Added strategic DEBUG logging for token operations, API calls, and rate limits

**Documentation:**
- [x] Updated README with new screenshots (zone devices, hot water controls, config UI)
- [x] Added dashboard card examples for hot water controls
- [x] Added debug logging guide in troubleshooting section
- [x] Service compatibility documentation

### v1.1.0

- [x] Link climate entities to Tado CE Hub device
- [x] Add Away Mode switch to manually toggle Home/Away status (1 API call per toggle)
- [x] Add `current_humidity` attribute to climate entities (no extra API calls)
- [x] Add preset mode support (Home/Away) to climate entities (1 API call per change)

### v1.0.1

- [x] Auto-fetch home ID from account (fixes 403 error for new users)

### v1.0.0

- [x] Initial release with full climate control, sensors, and API rate limit tracking
