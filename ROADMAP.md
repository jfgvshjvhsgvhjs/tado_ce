# Roadmap

Feature requests and planned improvements for Tado CE.

## Planned for v1.6.2

- [x] **Comprehensive timezone fixes** - All timestamps now stored in UTC, displayed in Home Assistant's configured timezone ([#46](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/46) - @hutten0)
- [x] **Fix API call history not recording** - `async_api.py` was missing call tracking (v1.6.0 regression)
- [x] **Fix blocking I/O warnings** - `api_call_tracker.py` now uses async file I/O via `run_in_executor`
- [x] **Fix `get_call_history` bug** - Naive vs aware datetime comparison was silently failing
- [x] **Fix thread leak on integration reload** - ThreadPoolExecutor now properly shutdown via `cleanup_executor()`

---

## Planned for v1.7.0

- [ ] **Optimistic state updates** - Immediate UI feedback when changing modes/temperature, with rollback on API failure ([#44](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/44) - @neonsp)

---

## Multi-Home Support Roadmap (v1.8.0 → v2.0.0)

Gradual migration path to support multiple Tado homes simultaneously.

### v1.8.0 - Unique ID Migration

- [ ] **Change integration unique_id** - From `tado_ce_integration` to `tado_ce_{home_id}`
- [ ] **Auto-migration** - Existing entries automatically updated, no user action needed
- [ ] **Backwards compatible** - Single home users unaffected

### v1.9.0 - Data Files Migration

- [ ] **Per-home data files** - `config_{home_id}.json`, `zones_{home_id}.json`, etc.
- [ ] **Auto-migration** - Existing files renamed with home_id suffix
- [ ] **Backwards compatible** - Falls back to legacy filenames if needed

### v1.10.0 - Hub Device Migration

- [ ] **Change hub device identifier** - From `tado_ce_hub` to `tado_ce_hub_{home_id}`
- [ ] **Device registry migration** - Existing hub device updated automatically
- [ ] **Entity IDs stable** - No entity ID changes for existing users

### v2.0.0 - Multiple Homes Enabled

- [ ] **Allow multiple integration entries** - Each entry for a different home
- [ ] **Delete tado_api.py** - File deprecated in v1.6.0, now fully removed
- [ ] **Better upgrade path testing** - Release beta versions for community testing
- [ ] **Documentation update** - Multi-home setup guide

**Note**: Entity IDs remain stable throughout migration if entity `unique_id` is unchanged.

**Migration Design**: All migrations are cumulative - users can upgrade directly from any version (e.g., v1.6.0 → v2.0.0) and all intermediate migrations will be applied automatically. Each migration step is idempotent (safe to run multiple times).

## Considering (Need More Feedback)

- Air Comfort sensors (humidity comfort level)
- Boost button entity
- Auto-assign devices to Areas during setup ([#14](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/14))
- Apply for HACS default repository inclusion
- Max Flow Temperature control (requires OpenTherm, [#15](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/15))
- Combi boiler mode - hide timers/schedules for on-demand hot water ([#15](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/15))

### Local API Support ([Discussion #29](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/discussions/29))

Investigating local API to reduce cloud dependency and API call usage.

- **TadoLocal project**: https://github.com/AmpScm/TadoLocal (early stage)
- **Goal**: Local-first, cloud-fallback approach
- **Benefits**: Works without subscription (100 calls/day limit), faster response, works when cloud is down
- **Status**: Gathering community feedback - react/comment on Discussion #29 if interested!

- [x] **Swing state persistence fix** - Preserve swing setting when changing temperature/fan/mode ([#31](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/31) - @neonsp)
- [x] **AC Power sensor fix** - Handle newer API format (`acPower.value` instead of `percentage`) ([#31](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/tado_ce/issues/31) - @neonsp)
- [x] **Entity unique_id stability** - Changed `TadoOpenWindowSensor` and `TadoEarlyStartSwitch` to use `zone_id` instead of `zone_name`

### v1.5.3 (2026-01-24)
